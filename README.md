`miactl` is the cli for Mia-Platform Console, it will eventually implement most of the actions you can do
via the UI.

## Install

You can install `miactl` on your system following one of the following methods.

### Using brew

If you have a system that use [brew] you can run the following command:

```sh
brew install mia-platform/tap/miactl
```

### Using curl or wget

You can download the `miactl` binaries directly from the release section on GitHub like this:

```sh
curl -fsSLo miactl.tar.gz https://github.com/mia-platform/miactl/releases/download/v0.3.1/miactl_Linux_arm64.tar.gz
tar -xzf miactl.tar.gz
sudo mv miactl /usr/local/bin/miactl
```

or alternatively via wget:

```sh
wget -O miactl.tar.gz https://github.com/mia-platform/miactl/releases/download/v0.3.1/miactl_Linux_arm64.tar.gz
tar -xzf miactl.tar.gz
sudo mv miactl /usr/local/bin/miactl
```

### Using Go

Another way to get miactl is to use directly `golang` with a version >= 1.15:

```sh
go install github.com/mia-platform/miactl@v0.3.1
```

## Example usage

### Get projects

```sh
miactl get projects --apiKey "your-api-key" --apiCookie "sid=your-sid" --endpoint "https://console.url/"
```

### Projects help

```sh
miactl help
```

## Enabling shell autocompletion

miactl provides autocompletion support for Bash, Zsh and Fish, which can save you a lot of typing.

### Bash

Completion could be generated running the `miactl completion bash` command.
To make this completion work, you should have [bash completion](https://github.com/scop/bash-completion)
correctly installed.

Warning: there are two versions of `bash-completion`, v1 and v2. V1 is for Bash 3.2 (which is the default on macOS),
and v2 is for Bash 4.1+. The miactl completion script requires `bash-completion` v2 and Bash 4.1+.

**For linux:**

You could install `bash-completion` running `apt-get install bash-completion`.

The above command create `/usr/share/bash-completion/bash_completion`, which is the main script of bash completion.
Try to run the command `type _init_completion`. If the command succeeds, youâ€™re already set. Otherwise, add to the
`~/.bashrc` file:

```sh
source /usr/share/bash-completion/bash_completion
```

After the correct installation if bash completion, you could make the completion works running:

```sh
miactl completion bash >/etc/bash_completion.d/miactl
```

**For osx:**

Check the bash version running `echo $BASH_VERSION`. If the version is less than 4.1, you should install a new bash
version with Homebrew running

```sh
brew install bash
```

Reload your shell and run the command `echo $BASH_VERSION` to verify the bash version.

Once installed the correct bash version, you should install `bash-completion` to v2. To check if it is already
installed, run `type _init_completion`. If not, you can install it with Homebrew

```sh
brew install bash-completion@2
````

And add in your `~/.bashrc` file:

```sh
export BASH_COMPLETION_COMPAT_DIR="/usr/local/etc/bash_completion.d"
[[ -r "/usr/local/etc/profile.d/bash_completion.sh" ]] && . "/usr/local/etc/profile.d/bash_completion.sh"
```

After the correct installation if bash completion, you could make the completion works running:

```sh
miactl completion bash >/etc/bash_completion.d/miactl
```

### Fish

Completion could be generated running the `miactl completion fish` command.

To make this completion work, you should run:

```sh
miactl completion fish >~/.config/fish/completions/miactl.fish
```

### Zsh

Completion could be generated running the `miactl completion zsh` command

The generated completion script should be put somewhere in your $fpath named _miactl.
